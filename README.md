# COMPETITIVE-PROGRAMMING
## -- Seasons of Code 2023

In the first month of SoC'23, I acquired valuable expertise in various areas including Data Structures, Sorting and Searching Algorithms, and the Divide and Conquer approach to Algorithmic Design Paradigm. Additionally, I consistently tackled several problem-solving challenges on CodeForces.

In the second month, I have done theory and practiced problems on DP, Greedy, BST, Graph based Algorithms.
